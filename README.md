# Python-SMTP-Email-Sender-with-Gmail-using-smtplib
This Python script demonstrates how to use the smtplib library to send an email using a Gmail account. The script establishes an SMTP connection with Gmail's servers and sends a simple email to a specified recipient

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
A Gmail account with a valid email address and password.
## Setup:

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the official website (https://www.python.org/).
Ensure you have a Gmail account to use for sending emails. If not, create a new one.
Enable "Less Secure Apps" on your Gmail account. To do this, follow these steps:
a. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security.
b. Under "Signing in to Google," click on "App passwords."
c. Enter your Google account password if prompted.
d. Scroll down to "Allow less secure apps" and turn it on. This allows the script to use SMTP to send emails.

## Configuration

Replace my_email with your Gmail email address.
Replace password with an "App Password" generated for your Gmail account (the one you set up in the "Setup" section).
